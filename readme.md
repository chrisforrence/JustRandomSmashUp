# [\#JustRandomSmashUp](http://www.justrandomsmashup.win)

\#JustRandomSmashUp is a project that I put together to randomly assign Smash Up factions to a number of players. While 2-4 is recommended, you _could_, with all of the available expansions, make a 21-person game. If that's how you want to roll, go for it.

## What did you use to put it together?

I used these languages, technologies and frameworks:

* PHP
* Laravel 5.2
* Vue.js
* PureCSS
* Smooth Scrolling
* SQLite

## ...why?

My wife and I enjoy playing Smash Up, and to make things a bit more interesting, we wanted to have our factions randomly assigned to us. However, not many of the faction random generators out there have all of the expansions. Since I have everything within a database, it's pretty darn simple to update this whenever a new expansion comes out.

## Who uses it?

My wife and I do! Our game group uses it as well. You can use it too!

## Well, where can I check it out?
